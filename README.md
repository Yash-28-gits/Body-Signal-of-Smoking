# Body-Signal-of-Smoking
This repository contains code and resources related to the analysis of body signals associated with smoking using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be found here.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset contains various physiological signals associated with smoking, including heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, and respiratory rate. Each instance in the dataset is labeled as either a smoker or a non-smoker.

## Methodology Highlights:
In this analysis, we adopted a Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble learning algorithm capable of handling multi-dimensional data effectively. To enhance the model's performance and computational efficiency, we implemented MaxPooling, a technique commonly utilized in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction. MaxPooling aids in downsampling the input representation, retaining the most critical information while reducing the dimensionality of the data.
